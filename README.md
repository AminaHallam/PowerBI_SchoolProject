Security Breaches Analysis and Power BI Dashboard
The objective of this lab is to perform comprehensive analysis and visualization of security breaches using Power BI. By leveraging data from MySQL and implementing various visualization techniques, the aim is to gain insights into breach trends, affected individuals, stolen
data, and other key metrics. The goal is to create an informative and interactive dashboard that enables stakeholders to understand the nature and impact of security breaches and make informed decisions regarding security measures and risk mitigation strategies.

In this PowerBI dashboard, you will create the following 3 pages.
1. Home Page: Provides an overview of key metrics.
2. Breach Analysis Page: Offers detailed insights into breaches.
3. Country Analysis Page: Focuses on breach analysis by country.
   
Home Page: Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

In this page, you must create the following KPIs.
1. Total Breaches
2. Open Breaches: Count of breaches with empty breach_end date (use COUNTBLANK)
3. Closed Breaches: Count of breaches with non-empty breach_end date
4. Estimated Total Stolen Data
5. Affected Employees
6. Secured Employees: (Total individuals - individuals affected)
7. Affected Employees %
8. Secured Employees %
   
Breach Analysis page KPIs:
1. Use slicer for filtering by year and month.
2. Total count of department and branch
3. Bar plots:
a. Count of breaches by theft type
b. Clustered bar chart for total vs. open breaches by individual who find out the
breach.
c. Clustered bar chart for total, affected, and secured individuals by branchPie Chart:
4. Pie Chart:
a. Visualizes the location of breached information using a pie chart, enabling users
to understand the distribution of compromised data across various locations or systems.

Breaches type analysis by Country
In this report, you must create the following KPIs.
1. Visualize open breaches by country using a map visual.
2. Display the trend of individuals affected by year with a line chart.
3. Illustrate the trend of stolen data by country using a line chart.
4. Incorporate a slicer filter for dynamic year selection.
5. Present the number of secured employees per country with a bar plot.
6. Compare open and closed breaches by country using a bar plot.
7. Below are the pages of your report to help you to build your own power bi dashboard.
